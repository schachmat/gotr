\section{Project Plan}

The goal of our work is to implement a free and open source library which is
independent of a specific IM client and provides the user with the group OTR
functionality proposed in \ref{impr-gotr}. The existing proof of concept
implementation for pidgin serves as reference to our planned improvements. We
aim to provide the group OTR algorithm under a standardized interface usable by
various existing IM clients as well as new IM concepts based on OTR only
communications. Further the correct functionality of our library is to be tested
with a simple \"client\". However we unfortunately can not evaluate the
cryptographic correctness of the proposed algorithm. This is left to people with
more crypto knowledge.
