# libgotr

libgotr is a library providing an [OTR](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/)-like encryption scheme for group
conversations.

## Build Dependencies

- libgcrypt v1.6.1 or higher

## Documentation

The API documentation can be built by running `make doc` inside the `libgotr`
folder. This requires Doxygen and some other tools to build the graphs. The API
documentation is not (yet) available to browse online.

Also the folders `expose`, `ghm_pres`, `presentation 1`,  `presentation2` and
`proposal` provide some deliverables required for the university course where
this library was developed.
