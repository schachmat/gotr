docu:
- trust is defined as a relation between two longterm public keys. A~B <==>
  owner of A trusts the owner of B to protect the private key b and does not
  provide it to any other party.
- a web of trust has drawbacks (citation needed), therefore we keep the trust db
  local and do not build transitive relations. to make this viable, we TOFU to
  establish a first level of trust.
- trust can be hardened by manual pubkey verification.
- since we use TOFU, we need to store the other parties account identifier
  together with the key and the trust level to detect when someone else is using
  a known account with a new key (impersonation) and display a warning to the
  user. => trust db entry consists of:
  - other users pubkey
  - other users accound id
  - trust level
